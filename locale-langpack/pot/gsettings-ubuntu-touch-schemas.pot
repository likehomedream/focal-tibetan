"Per monitor scale factor for all user interface components. The values are "
"stored in a dictionary where the keys are IDs of monitors and the values are"
" the scale factors. The scale factors are not the traditional float scale "
"factors that one might expect. Instead they are integers that need to be "
"divided by 8 before being used as regular scale factors. That limits the "
"number of possible scalings applied to the UI without jeopardizing "
"flexibility (there is still enough possible scalings for all devices out "
"there). This limiting allows for better testing since there is now only a "
"finite number of possible scalings. The scale factor also maps directly to "
"the grid units used in the Ubuntu UI Toolkit where one grid unit is exactly "
"equal to 'scale factor' number of pixels."
