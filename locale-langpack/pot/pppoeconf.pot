"Most providers send the needed login information per mail. Some providers describe it in odd ways, assuming the user to input the data in their \"user-friendly\" setup programs. But in fact, these applications generate usuall PPP user names and passwords from the entered data. You can find the real names too and input the correct data in the dialog box.\n"

"Many providers have routers that do not support TCP packets with a MSS higher than 1460. Usually, outgoing packets have this MSS when they go through one real Ethernet link with the default MTU size (1500). Unfortunately, if you are forwarding packets from other hosts (i.e. doing masquerading) the MSS may be increased depending on the packet size and the route to the client hosts, so your client machines won't be able to connect to some sites. There is a solution: the maximum MSS can be limited by pppoe. You can find more details about this issue in the pppoe documentation.\n"

"If unsure, say yes.\n"
