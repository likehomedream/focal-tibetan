"(or \"perm-mac\"), the last 4 bytes of the current (or permanent) MAC "

"hashing the interface name. The special value \"stable\" can be used to "
"generate an IAID based on the stable-id (see connection.stable-id), a per-"
"host key and the interface name. When the property is unset, the value from "

"A string containing the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID) used by the dhcp "
"client to identify itself to DHCPv6 servers (RFC 3315). The DUID is carried "
"in the Client Identifier option. If the property is a hex string "
"('aa:bb:cc') it is interpreted as a binary DUID and filled as an opaque "
"value in the Client Identifier option. The special value \"lease\" will "
"retrieve the DUID previously used from the lease file belonging to the "
"connection. If no DUID is found and \"dhclient\" is the configured dhcp "
"client, the DUID is searched in the system-wide dhclient lease file. If "
"still no DUID is found, or another dhcp client is used, a global and "
"permanent DUID-UUID (RFC 6355) will be generated based on the machine-id. "
"The special values \"llt\" and \"ll\" will generate a DUID of type LLT or LL"
" (see RFC 3315) based on the current MAC address of the device. In order to "
"try providing a stable DUID-LLT, the time field will contain a constant "
"timestamp that is used globally (for all profiles) and persisted to disk. "
"The special values \"stable-llt\", \"stable-ll\" and \"stable-uuid\" will "
"generate a DUID of the corresponding type, derived from the connection's "
"stable-id and a per-host unique key. You may want to include the "
"\"${DEVICE}\" or \"${MAC}\" specifier in the stable-id, in case this profile"
" gets activated on multiple devices. So, the link-layer address of \"stable-"
"ll\" and \"stable-llt\" will be a generated address derived from the stable "
"id. The DUID-LLT time value in the \"stable-llt\" option will be picked "
"among a static timespan of three years (the upper bound of the interval is "
"the same constant timestamp used in \"llt\"). When the property is unset, "
"the global value provided for \"ipv6.dhcp-duid\" is used. If no global value"

msgid ""
"A string sent to the DHCP server to identify the local machine which the "

"property is a hex string ('aa:bb:cc') it is interpreted as a binary client "

"RFC 2132 section 9.14 and the remaining bytes may be an hardware address "
"(e.g. '01:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx' where 1 is the Ethernet ARP type and the rest "
"is a MAC address). If the property is not a hex string it is considered as a"
" non-hardware-address client ID and the 'type' field is set to 0. The "
"special values \"mac\" and \"perm-mac\" are supported, which use the current"
" or permanent MAC address of the device to generate a client identifier with"
" type ethernet (01). Currently, these options only work for ethernet type of"
" links. The special value \"duid\" generates a RFC4361-compliant client "
"identifier based on a hash of the interface name as IAID and /etc/machine-"
"id. The special value \"stable\" is supported to generate a type 0 client "
"identifier based on the stable-id (see connection.stable-id) and a per-host "
"key. If you set the stable-id, you may want to include the \"${DEVICE}\" or "
"\"${MAC}\" specifier to get a per-device key. If unset, a globally "

"DHCP, SLAAC, default-routes and static routes. But note that static routes "
"can individually overwrite the setting by explicitly specifying a non-zero "
"routing table. If the table setting is left at zero, it is eligible to be "

"This represents the identity of the connection used for various purposes. It"
