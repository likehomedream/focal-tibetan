"Work dir for asynchronous task operations. The directory set here will be "
"used to operate over images - normally before they are imported in the "

"provided for concurrent tasks to run efficiently without running out of "
"space. A rough estimation can be done by multiplying the number of "
"`max_workers` - or the N of workers running - by an average image size (e.g "
"500MB). The image size estimation should be done based on the average size "
"in your deployment. Note that depending on the tasks running you may need to"
" multiply this number by some factor depending on what the task does. For "
"example, you may want to double the available size if image conversion is "
"enabled. All this being said, remember these are just estimations and you "
"should do them based on the worst case scenario and be prepared to act in "
